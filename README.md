# ArduinoShifter
This Arduiono shifter are my first arduino project. 
I bought a shifter from Ebay with a Attiny 85 board that failed somehow. I first tried replacing the board but it fried even faster. Now i'm trying with an external board outside of the shifter. This project is only for fun and needs this Joystick Library https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary
